# Channel Playbooks

Use these stacks to choose execution order by business model.

## Primary Stacks by Business Type

| Business Type | Primary Stack | Secondary Stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Info / Education | Foundation -> Conversion | Traffic -> Nurture |
| Consulting / Agency | Foundation -> Traffic | Nurture -> Conversion |
| E-commerce | Conversion -> Traffic | Nurture (email-heavy) |
| SaaS | Conversion -> Nurture | Traffic (SEO/content) |

## Stack Definitions

### Foundation Stack

`Research -> Voice -> Positioning`

Use when identity and differentiation are unclear.

Outputs:

- Voice profile.
- 3-5 positioning angles.
- One chosen angle with risks and proof.

### Conversion Stack

`Landing Copy -> Offer Bridge -> Lead Magnet -> Nurture Sequence`

Use when traffic exists but conversion is weak.

Outputs:

- Conversion-first landing copy.
- Clear offer structure and CTA.
- 7-email sequence mapped by intent.

### Traffic Stack

`Keyword Gaps -> Content Pillars -> Distribution Plan`

Use when demand capture is weak.

Outputs:

- Keyword opportunity map.
- 60-90 day content calendar.
- Cross-channel repurposing plan.

### Nurture Stack

`Lifecycle Email -> Newsletter -> Retargeting`

Use when acquisition exists but lead-to-sale conversion is slow.

Outputs:

- Lifecycle email flows.
- Newsletter framework.
- Retargeting message map by funnel stage.

## Paid + Organic Integration Rules

- Use paid to test message velocity quickly.
- Feed winning hooks/headlines into organic content.
- Feed top-performing organic posts into paid variants.
- Align landing page narrative across both paths.

## Creative Iteration Loop

1. Launch 3-5 angles.
2. Keep only measurable winners.
3. Expand winners into 5-10 variants.
4. Retire low-performing angle families.

## Offer Design Patterns

Use one primary offer and one secondary offer:

- Primary: conversion action (demo, trial, call, checkout).
- Secondary: lower-friction bridge (checklist, calculator, template, teardown).

## Metric Priorities by Funnel Stage

| Stage | Primary Metric | Secondary Metric |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TOFU | Qualified reach | CTR / engagement quality |
| MOFU | Lead quality | Reply rate / content depth |
| BOFU | Conversion rate | CAC / payback / close rate |
| Retention | Activation / retention | Expansion / referral rate |
